# AGENTS.md — handoff notes for Claude / coding agents

This file gives the next session enough context to keep going without
re-deriving everything from scratch. Treat it as living docs — keep it short
and current; delete stale notes rather than leaving them.

## What this project is

ESP32-2432S028R "Cheap Yellow Display" firmware: a 320×240 stock ticker.
List screen of symbols, detail screen with a chart, on-device settings info
screen, and a small web admin at `/settings` for editing the RapidAPI key /
symbols / refresh interval.

## Stack & invariants

- **PlatformIO** env `cyd`, board `esp32dev`, Arduino-ESP32 framework.
- **LVGL 9.5** (pulled by `lvgl @ ^9.2.2` — caret resolves up). LVGL config
  lives in `include/lv_conf.h`; the project uses `LV_CONF_INCLUDE_SIMPLE` and
  `-I include` so this file is the single source of truth.
- **LovyanGFX 1.2.x** for ILI9341 + XPT2046. The `Touch_XPT2046` driver
  carries its own SPI pin config in this version — there is *no*
  `setBus()` method. See `src/display/lgfx_cyd.hpp`.
- **Two FreeRTOS tasks**, pinned: `uiTask` on core 1 (LVGL), `netTask` on
  core 0 (WiFi + HTTPS + web admin). They share `QuoteStore` and
  `SettingsStore` under a mutex. LVGL itself is single-threaded behind
  `g_lvglMu`; LVGL's own OSAL is set to `LV_OS_NONE` because ESP-IDF doesn't
  ship the `atomic.h` that LVGL's FreeRTOS OSAL expects.
- **JSON parsing**: ArduinoJson v7 with a `close`-only filter to keep the
  streamed body off the heap. Tolerates three response shapes: `body[]`,
  `data.items[]`, `data.prices[]`. Both numeric and string close values are
  accepted.
- **HTTPS**: `WiFiClientSecure::setInsecure()` + `http.useHTTP10(true)` +
  `Accept-Encoding: identity`. Don't change these without testing — they
  are workarounds for actual breakage on this RapidAPI host.

## Memory budget (the part that bites)

Last clean build: **RAM 34.7%**, **Flash 78.8%**. DRAM is the constraint when
adding LVGL features. Two main levers:

- `LINES` in `src/display/lvgl_bridge.cpp` — partial-render flush buffer
  height. Currently 16 (two buffers of 320×16×2 = ~20 KB total).
- `LV_MEM_SIZE` in `include/lv_conf.h` — LVGL heap. Currently 32 KB.

If a future change overflows DRAM (link error
`region 'dram0_0_seg' overflowed`), drop `LINES` or `LV_MEM_SIZE` before
adding bigger fonts. Fonts go in flash, not DRAM — adding a Montserrat size
costs flash, not DRAM.

## Source layout

  ui/
    styles.{h,cpp}               colors, fonts, brand_color(symbol) lookup
    logos.{h,cpp}                PNG via LVGL/lodepng with badge fallback
    list_screen.{h,cpp}          status bar (wifi/title/clock/gear) + rows
    detail_screen.{h,cpp}        header card + chart card + stats
    settings_screen.{h,cpp}      read-only on-device info screen
```

## How features wire together

- **Brand colors**: `styles::brand_color(symbol)` first hits `kBrandTable`,
  then falls back to an FNV hash into `kFallback`. Used by both the badge and
  (optionally) the chart line.
- **Sparklines on list rows**: derived from the same `fetchQuotes` response.
  The fetcher requests `limit=SPARKLINE_POINTS` daily bars per symbol and the
  last N closes get stored on `Quote::sparkline`. The list draws them with
  `lv_line` (one per row) — no extra API calls.
- **Detail history**: separate on-demand fetch (`limit=HISTORY_POINTS`) when
  a row is tapped. Pending request flows UI -> store -> net via
  `requestHistory` / `takePendingHistory`.
- **Logos**: `logos::make(parent, sym, size)` tries
  `L:/logos/<SYMBOL>.png` (LVGL FS driver -> LittleFS); on miss it draws a
  circular brand-colored badge with letters. Logo PNGs live in
  `data/logos/` and are uploaded with `pio run -t uploadfs`. The folder may
  be empty.
- **Settings screen**: read-only. Editing happens in the web admin (no
  on-device keyboard). The screen pulls live WiFi info each tick and
  exposes the `http://<ip>/` URL so the user knows where to go.

## Build / verify

```
pio run -e cyd                     # compile + link
pio run -e cyd -t upload           # flash firmware
pio run -e cyd -t uploadfs         # flash LittleFS (settings + logos)
pio device monitor                 # serial @ 115200
```

PIO path on Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.platformio\penv\Scripts\pio.exe`.

## Conventions

- C++17, two-space indent, `lower_snake` namespaces, `CamelCase` types,
  `g_` prefix for file-locals.
- Comments only when the *why* is non-obvious. Avoid restating what the
  code does.
- Don't introduce new abstractions for hypothetical needs. The codebase
  prefers one explicit way per feature.
- LVGL widget construction: when overriding most of a style, call
  `lv_obj_remove_style_all(obj)` first, then layer the project's named
  styles from `styles.cpp`.
- Event bubbling: child widgets inside a clickable card should set
  `LV_OBJ_FLAG_EVENT_BUBBLE` so taps reach the parent.

## Known pitfalls / footguns

- **`LV_USE_SPINNER` requires `LV_USE_ARC`** in LVGL 9.5. Both are on.
- **`LV_USE_OS LV_OS_FREERTOS`** pulls in `lv_freertos.c` which
  `#include "atomic.h"` — missing on ESP-IDF. Stay on `LV_OS_NONE`.
- **`Touch_XPT2046::setBus()` does not exist** in this LovyanGFX. SPI pins
  go directly into the touch config struct.
- **Quote/History String + Arduino.h**: any header that uses `String` must
  `#include <Arduino.h>` itself; don't rely on the includer.
- **DRAM-tight links**: see the memory budget section above before adding
  fonts/widgets.

## Recently shipped (most recent first)

- On-device read-only settings info screen + gear button in status bar; wifi
  glyph is now color-coded and shows RSSI dBm.
- Logo widget (PNG from LittleFS via custom LVGL FS driver, brand-colored
  letter badge fallback), full UI polish pass: sparklines on list rows,
  area-fill chart on detail with high/low/range stats, broader font ramp.
- Pre-existing build issues uncovered in the polish pass and fixed:
  `Touch_XPT2046::setBus()` removed, `Arduino.h` added to `quote_fetcher.h`,
  `LV_USE_ARC` enabled, `LV_USE_OS` switched to `LV_OS_NONE`.

## Likely next asks

- Bundle some real logo PNGs in `data/logos/`. The infrastructure is in
  place; what's missing is licensed art.
- Long-press a row to mark it as a "favorite" / pin to top.
- Show a tiny clock (NTP-synced) in the status bar.
- Switch to hourly bars (`interval=1h`) on a long-press of the chart.
- Per-symbol price-alert thresholds in the settings form.

Don't pre-build any of these unless asked — list them so the next session
has a head start.
